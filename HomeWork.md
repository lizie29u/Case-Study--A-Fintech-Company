## Overview and Origin

The financial sector landscape has evolved rapidly over the last decade or so. This case study will provide a snipet of this evolution through the study of a canadian company, Carta Worldwide. I will priovide a brief description of the changes in the payment ecosystem and illustrate how Carta Worldwide has responded to these changes.

**Name of Company:

Carta Worldwide



**When was the company incorporated:

Carta was incorporated in 2006 

**Who are the Founders

The company was founded by Robert Elensky.

**How How did the idea for the company  come about

The company was formed to bridge the gap between legacy sytems and emerging technologies. According to their website, " In 2008, we viewed the rapidly evolving landscape of payments around the world and saw a disconnect between the disruptive innovation taking place and the legacy systems in market".

How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Carta is funded through a combination of Private Equity and Venture series. 
To date they have raised a total of CAD $51M (1)

 ## Business Activities:

**What specific financial problem is the company trying to solve?

The company's primary focus is to provide technolgy  that can easily integrate legacy systems into the ever evolving payment  ecosystem. As consumers crave more efficiency, there is an increasing desire for a reduction in transaction processing time. Disruptions in this industry have led financial institutions to provide more real time processing.  CartaWorlwide is seeking to supply the technology to accomplish this goal.

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The client base is predominantly financial institutions and in prticular the retail banking industry. However, they also service merchants and retailers

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?

Quoted from the company's website: "Carta’s open platform architecture provides unlimited opportunity for configurability and brandability, while boasting the industry’s fastest deployment to market". The advantage they have is their short turn around time in bringing end product to market.

Though there is lots of competition in this domain Carta Worldwide feels it has a distinct advantage over its competitors in the form of it’s technology. Their technology is fully compatible with the traditional legacy transaction systems. Thus, clients can easily migrate from their existing payment infrastructure. As a result, Carta Worldwide is today, the leading provider of processing technology platforms that is capable of enabling global payments (2)

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?

Carta uses  Host Card Emulation and cloudbased secure element platforms which make it it cheaper to develop NFC payment element on androids.

 Tokenization is an integral part of their technology which greatly improves security. As such, Carta is able to make payments simplier, at the same time reducing the risk of fraud. Carta stores all its Canadian customers’ sensitive information and financial data, at its PEI facility. In fact they are the only third party processing company that completes all processing in Canada (3)

"Carta’s Token Processing Appliance (TPA) enables HCE and tokenization-based mobile payments deployment with a turn-key solution. It simplifies on-premises implementation using a highly configurable and easily integrated set of hardware and software modules. The TPA is the first ever product available in market that delivers a complete package of requisite components for cloud based payments—including tokenization—for in-house deployment. " (3)

A major advantage of TPA is that it makes possible for multiple programs to share the same infrastructure in a segregated virtual environment. This could be housed internally at the issuing bank or offered as a service on behalf of banks.   This is a long term arrangement which can easily adapt to the ever changing needs and advances in technology.

## Landscape

**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Carta Worldwide is in the Payments (paytech) domain


**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

According to Sue Britton, CEO & Founder of FGS. "The Canadian financial services market is experiencing a dramatic increase of fierce competition driven by the availability of new technology" (4)
In recent years the sector has seen more and more disruptions, driven by increasing customer demands for speed and efficiency. The domain is seeing evolution through cheques, cards, payments, digital commerce and digital convergence. Over the last 10 years, there has been a gradual move towards electronic payment and in more recent years, crypto currencies and digital wallets, in-app payments, and app-based virtual banks.. In fact  one in four of all transactions today are via contactless cards or device (5)

According to a recent CPA study quoted by a Media planet report 
approximately 70 % of Canadians use smartphones,
35 % use banking in the last year
48%  percent of Canadians are now using online banking as their primary method of bill payment (6)


In fact, the report also cites that Cash now represents only 43 percent of the total transactions at point of sale. It is hard to imagine that we will ever totally eliminate the need for cash. However, in more and more facets of our lives we are finding that we are being more far removed from cash.  Take for example, the popular rideshare service, Uber. This service completely eliminates the need for cash. Users provide their payment information at the time of registration. When the service is used, payment is completed automatically through the billing information on file.
